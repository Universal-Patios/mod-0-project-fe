## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel good about asking questions. I like the advice to ask for help after 30 minutes of being stuck. Usually I
tend to wait longer than I should to ask for help. But it seems easy and very encouraged to ask for help in the
environment Turing creates. I realize its valuable to try to solve a problem on your own, but its wasteful to spend
too much time working on the problem if you are stuck.


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

I learned about string, number, and boolean data types in this section.
* A string is a set of letters or other characters contained within quotes. Even numbers can be in a string if they are inside the quotes.
* A number is any positive, negative, or floating point number that defines a variable.
* A boolean is a data type with a true or a false value.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```


4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

You would use either // for mostly single line comments and /* */for multi-line comments. The purpose of code comments is to
add information for other developers and to de-activate any code you want to keep from running.


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a way to store information. It is like a box that has something in it. When you use the box the thing inside the box is accessed.


6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

My email login

`var username = string`
`var logInAttempts = number`
`var isLoggedIn = boolean`


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is a way to join together strings and variables with different values.


8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

Spotify. They used concatenation when combining information on an artist. For example it could be something like this

`var paulMcartney = "${songs} + ${albums} + ${genre}";`


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

What exactly is `console.log` and what is it doing when you use it? I understand the variables and how that information is integrated, but I'm unclear on exactly what putting them into `console.log` ,like we have in these exercises, does exactly. I'm sure with different examples and more practice the concept behind JS will become more clear.
