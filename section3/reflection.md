## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

- It felt a little more challenging, but good. I was able to successfully search for and find resources that helped me with
what I needed.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

- In my email application they use arrays to store user information. An array can be created for a certain user and contain information like their username, password, phone number, and any other relevant information about that user.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

- An array is variable that stores a list of values. Those values can consist of all primitive data types (integers, strings, booleans).

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

- The purpose of a loop is to have one set of code that runs multiple times until a condition is met. This allows the code to just be written once instead of the number of times you want it repeated. You would use a loop in conjunction with an array when you want to want to check a condition for each element in that array. For example if you have an array of payment data and want to see if each element has made a payment you could run a loop that would return a boolean for each element. You could use a loop without an array if you wanted to repeat an action a certain number of times. For example if you wanted to have a timer count down to 10 you could have a `for` loop that counts down until it reaches 0.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

- A loop is tool that can be used to repeat something multiple times by only doing it once. Its like pushing a button and having a revolving door keep spinning until it is stopped. As opposed to having to push the button each time you want the door to spin.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

- I feel pretty comfortable with the information up to this point. I just feel that I need more practice and examples to really understand the value of certain methods on arrays like `pop`. Right now I understand what it does. I just don't completly understand its usefulness yet.
