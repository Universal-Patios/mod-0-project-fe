### Describe in your own words what each method does:

* `pop` - The pop method removes the last element from an array which decreases the length of the array by 1. After being removed the  element is then returned. The element that is removed can be assigned to another variable. Pop can be used to remove each element in an array until the array is empty. Almost like a count down timer

* `push` - The push method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the the new length of it. Since more elements are added to the array the length will be changed when this method is used

* `shift` - The shift method removes the first element from an array, changing the length of it. The element that was removed is then returned. This works like the converse of the `pop` method and is better used when you want to remove just the first element from an array and nothing else.

* `unshift` - The unshift method adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array and returns the new length. This also moves all the existing elements in that array to the right by a corresponding number of index's compared to what was added.
